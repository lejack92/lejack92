# Pheromone test

※ Pheromone: A chemical signal that attracts reason.

Pheromone, a chemical signal that attracts reason.
I'm sure everyone has heard of it at least once.

(There's an AI that measures pheromones like this?)


AI content that was introduced as a content in Korea's famous TV show Running Man.
Introduce the pheromone tests provided by AlphaFace.

<a href="https://alphaface-ai.com/pheromonetest/">'>Go to Pheromone Test'</a>



## Pheromone Test Features

![pheromonetest_page](/assets/img/33-2.jpg)

The way to measure pheromones with AI is very simple.

You just put a picture of your face in there.
AI learned with enormous data measures and shows pheromone scores that attract reason.

AI that expresses "Heart ♥" as a score like the picture below.


## Notes

but,
Since the learned AI judges, AI may measure different pheromone scores depending on the angle and mood expression.

It depends on the atmosphere and the condition of the day.

Put your life picture in and ask AI to score pheromones.

I recommend that you try it simply for fun.

No matter how learned AI is, it's bound to make mistakes.

After the test, share the results with your friends or acquaintances to check the accuracy.

You're going to have a fun day.
